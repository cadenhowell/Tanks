		Player 1
			W = Forward
			S = Backward
			A = Rotate Counterclockwise
			D = Rotate Clockwise
			F = Fire

		You're goal is to shoot the other tank. Bullets will bounce twice. The barriers will destroy bullets and slow the tanks down.

	Sometimes the games functionality breaks down on a Mac. If during the game it freezes there may be a issue with the computer.
